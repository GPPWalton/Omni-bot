# Omni-bot
## Introduction
The Omni Bot is a differential drive robot with an omnidirectional camera, built for usage with various Visual Compass algorithms. The robot itself is modelled with only minimal sensors, to show that this can be performed using low-budget robots and sensors. The algorithm included in the initial release is based on work by Wystrach et al., (2013). In that it performs a 'learning walk' to record several snapshots of it's route before attempting to use those snapshots to return home. In the future, more variants will be added, such as the original Cartwright and Collett (1983) method and some other variations.
